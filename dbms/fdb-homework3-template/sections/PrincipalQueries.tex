\section{Principal Queries}

In this section we propose some queries to access our database:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Find the most rented models, i.e. the cars that were rented above the average.
	\item Find the best performing branch in terms of total income from sales.
	\item Find the best-selling car model.
	\item For each kind of replacement part, find the supplier which supplies it at lowest cost.
\end{enumerate}
