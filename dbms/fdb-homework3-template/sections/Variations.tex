\section{Variations to the Relational Schema}
The relational schema was modified as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The entities NewCar and UsedCar were merged in a new Car entity.
	\item The schema now models some extra date and price attributes in Rental and Repair.
	\item The Replacement now refers to an instance of a part and PartKind models the catalog of parts.
	\item A new entity Model was added to represent the exact model of a Car.
	\item Some more minor tweaks were applied.
\end{itemize}
