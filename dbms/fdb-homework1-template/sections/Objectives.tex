%Brief description of the overall objectives of your system.
%What your system will be used for? Why is it important? What problems does it solve?

Our client's business assets are cars (both new and used) and replacement pieces.
The customers usually buy cars but it's offered to them the possibility of renting.
The people involved are clients, suppliers and workers.
Our project is a database management system which keeps track of all the data related
to the sales, rentals and repairs of vehicles, as well as records of payments and current rents.

\medskip

\noindent We want to automate the management of the activities of a chain of car dealerships
for which we want to collect data relating to the sale and repair of motor vehicles.
The reality of interest keeps track of customers and suppliers of the dealerships
who will provide the spare parts used in maintenance.
