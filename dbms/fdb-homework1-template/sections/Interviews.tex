\section{Interviews}
%who are we going to interview in order to obtain the proper information on the system?
%do we interview the final user? the managers? the analysts?

We have done different interviews to different workers on the car dealer market to better comprehend the requirements for the database.
 \begin{itemize}
	 \item \textbf{Company managers}: the main stakeholders, they described how the database should be like. With general guidelines,
	  like the need of tracking sales, rents and repairs of the different car dealers.
	  \item \textbf{Finance Team}: their request was to keep track of the money made in the sales (if discount were applied), 
	  the monthly rental price agreed with the buyer and the price for the repairs. Another important aspect is to keep track 
	  of the cost per unit of the replacement parts.
	  \item \textbf{Mechanic}: they described us how a repair works, how they find the replacement parts from different suppliers.
	  \item \textbf{Sellers}: they told us the different possibilities of contracts: Sell or Rent and how 
	  they keep notes on every buyer to later call them for new businesses.
