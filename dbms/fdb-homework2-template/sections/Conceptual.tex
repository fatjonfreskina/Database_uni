\section{Conceptual Design}

\subsection{Variations to the Requirement Analysis}

After a second round of intervews with the Stakeholders we have clarified some doubts: \\
\textbf{Car Dealer} is the local physical car shop and as such has it's own employees, that are: Sellers, Mechanics and the Finance Team. By our design, since the business is constantly growing, any new work role can be easily implemented in the database without problems. Once we clarified that Car Dealer is the single local shop we can continue, as agreed, to identify the different local business by their Names. \\
We made some clarification also about the repair service. As of now it exists only to repair the rentable cars. We discussed if the policy could change in the future, in order to allow repairs to customers too, so we agreed on adding a new entity \textbf{External Cars} related to Customers and Repair current entities.
