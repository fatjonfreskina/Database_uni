# Database_uni
Foundations of Databases university project

This is a project I had the opportunity to build with a group of 6 people. 

I learnt about the Life cycle of an information system, the requirement analysis, the Database design and the Conceptual, Logical and Physical design. 

I practiced Visual Studio Code, Git, PostgreSQL, JDBC.
